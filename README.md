- Hi, I’m Gustavo Paz
- I’m interested in learn how this world works. Eventually we meet people who simply wants to learn how to program, but i think that programming isn't just the language, but a creative capacity that is off the screen, that's what i'm looking for.
- I’m currently entering in the the 4th semester of analysis and systems development college.
- I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, educational initiatives, and any innovative project.
- Feel free to add me on my LinkedIn page https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustnunespaz/ and instagram account https://www.instagram.com/gustnunespaz/
- Fun fact about me is that i love to lean new things, for exemple, i a musician since 10 years old. I play guitar, bass and piano. I speak english and i'm leaning korean and esperanto.

- It's a pleasure to learn with you!

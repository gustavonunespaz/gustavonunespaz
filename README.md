- 👋 Hi, I’m Gustavo Paz
- 👀 I’m interested in learn how this world works. Eventually we meet people who simply wants to learn how to program, but i think that programming isn't just the language, but a creative capacity that is off the screen, that's what i'm looking for.
- 🌱 I’m currently entering in the the 3th semester of analysis and systems development college. I'm also studying algorithms, Python, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, educational initiatives, and any innovative project.
- 📫 Feel free to add me on my LinkedIn page https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustnunespaz/ and instagram account https://www.instagram.com/gustnunespaz/
- ⚡ Fun fact about me is that i love to lean new things, for exemple, i a musician since 10 years old. I play guitar, bass and piano. I speak english and i'm leaning korean and esperanto.

- It's a pleasure to learn with you!
